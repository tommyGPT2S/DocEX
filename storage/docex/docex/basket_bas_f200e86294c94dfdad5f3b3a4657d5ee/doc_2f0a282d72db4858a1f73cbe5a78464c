Database management systems store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently. Relational databases like 
                PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite use structured query language (SQL) and follow ACID principles. NoSQL databases 
                include document stores (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), column-family (Cassandra), and graph databases (Neo4j). 
                Vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS specialize in storing and searching high-dimensional vectors 
                for machine learning applications. Database design involves normalization, indexing, and query optimization.
