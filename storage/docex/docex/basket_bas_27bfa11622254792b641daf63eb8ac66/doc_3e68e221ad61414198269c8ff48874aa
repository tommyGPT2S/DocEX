Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional 
                vectors efficiently. They are essential for modern AI applications including semantic search, recommendation systems, 
                and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, and 
                Chroma. These systems use sophisticated indexing algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, HNSW 
                (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds), and IVF (Inverted File) to enable fast similarity search across millions 
                or billions of vectors.
