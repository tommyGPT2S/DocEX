Artificial Intelligence encompasses machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, 
                and robotics. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers 
                to model and understand complex patterns in data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image recognition, 
                Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers handle sequential data like text and speech. Popular frameworks 
                include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Applications span from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis and 
                language translation.
