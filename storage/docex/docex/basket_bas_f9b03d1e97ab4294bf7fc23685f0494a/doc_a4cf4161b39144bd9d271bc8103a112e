Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to automatically learn 
                and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The field encompasses supervised learning 
                (classification and regression), unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction), and 
                reinforcement learning. Popular algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, 
                random forests, support vector machines, k-means clustering, and neural networks. Modern deep learning 
                approaches use multi-layered neural networks for complex pattern recognition tasks.
