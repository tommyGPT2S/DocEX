Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
                Key tasks include tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, 
                and text summarization. Modern NLP relies heavily on transformer architectures like BERT, GPT, T5, and their variants. 
                Embedding models convert text into dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity 
                comparisons and downstream machine learning tasks. Applications range from chatbots and virtual assistants to 
                document analysis and content generation.
